This is just a trial to practice some concepts. I just learned some basics about **dynamic routing**,  **Css Modules Rendering**, exploring some libraries like **Graymatter** that allows us to parse metada from md files.

I also learned about **YAML front matter** which is the part of the md file containing the meta data information and rendering options and ofcourse **SSR** and **SG** which are the pre-rendering oprtions of using **Next.js**.

**Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.

**Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.
