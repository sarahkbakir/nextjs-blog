## Web Design for Everybody:
### Basics of Web Development and Coding
The 5 courses specialization was very helpful with building a solid base as it was introductory courses but had a lot of useful learning and practicing resources. I also explored **Figma** while learning how to sketch website UI in early ideation states, and used it to deliver wireframes for {Mobile and desktop} views for the capstone project course. Each course has projects to practice lessons and get reviews for insights.

* **HTML5**
