## Exploring The world of Front end development

### Learning path :
I started my learning journey last year. I began practicing basic coding fundamentals through courses, then my **Front-End Development** interest became more and more everyday. I'm a step away from becoming a professional **Front-End Developer**, But I'm proud of what I achieved so far.

I started from scratch and I think resources and steps I took can be helpful to others. First thing I learned, and that would be    **My Advice is to always go for the official Documentation, Always!**, but other resources can be informative and helpful too.

There are some resources that helped me and others I knew about later but still would be very helpful to others during their learning journey.

### Problem solving :
I love problem solving time, and unless I manage to make time limits for myself, I can spend everyday all day solving problems on platforms and learning tricks, ideas, concepts and methods. It's very challenging and rewarding. I would reccomend though starting with beginner level problems and leveling up rather than just going random because as a beginner failing at solving problems will be very disappointing.

I found a couple of lists of **Problem Solving** websites, tried some of them and would happily reccomend some of which I loved, found very entertaining and helpful.
